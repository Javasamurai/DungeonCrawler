### Issac Chronicles
The game in mind was Binding of Issac but with weird powerups.

- BIGG (Makes the player big, easier to kill)

- Time (Makes the game faster)

- Magnet (Players getting chased by everyone)

- Misdirect (My favorite, Controls are reverse in this, makes you relearn and adapt)

- Turnbase (Only if the player moves, enemies move as well)

- DOT (Makes bullets smaller and slower)



The enemies types:

- Chaser (Follows player)

- High damage (Slow but gives high damage and explodes)

- Patroller (Moves to and fro)

- Turret (Shoots at the player at stationary position)
